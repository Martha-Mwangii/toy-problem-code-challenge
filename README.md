### StuGradeGen.js 
Prompts user to enter the student's mark,if the mark entered is not a number(isNaN)it returns a message "You entered an invalid grade,Please enter a number between 0 and 100",this applies to a number less than zero or a number more than 100. 
there is use of a global variable ,mark, in the first code and use of a local variable in the second code(commented).
the third commented code has been implemented by using prompt and alert where the return also pops up (alert).

### SpeedDetector.js 
The program defines the speed limit and the number of kilometers per demerit point. If the driver's speed is less than or equal to the speed limit(70), it outputs "Ok". Otherwise, it calculates the number of demerit points by subtracting the speed limit from the driver's speed and dividing by the kilometers per demerit point. We use the Math.floor function to round to the nearest integer. it checks if the driver has accumulated enough demerit points(>12) to have their license suspended. If so, it outputs "License suspended".
